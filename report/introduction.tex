\section{Introduction}
In this report, we present a general pipeline that can inject faults into programs, extract useful features from the raw microarchitecture events and analyze how injected fault can impact program outcomes. Detect transient fault has been a research topic in robust system design for years. We utilize gemFI \cite{parasyris2014gemfi} which is a fault injection tool based on Gem5\cite{Binkert:2011:GS:2024716.2024718} to study how faults are going to affect programs. Our contribution is two-fold: we implemented a general pipeline that can extract and label features from any fault injection simulator and any target application, and provide analysis on how to predict fault and program outcome based on a machine learning approach. Figure~\ref{fig:teaser} shows the overview of our approach.
