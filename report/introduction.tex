\section{Introduction}
In this report, we present a pipeline that can inject faults into programs and analyze how injected fault can alter program outcomes. To detect transient fault has been a research topic in robust system design for years. We utilize gemFI to study how faults are going to affect programs. Our contribution is two-fold: we implemented a fault inject pipeline, and provide analysis on how to predict fault and program outcome based on a machine learning approach. Figure~\ref{fig:teaser} shows the overview of our approach.
