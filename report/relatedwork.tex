\section{Related Work}
There are other simulation based fault injection tools. \cite{Benso:2010:FIT:1965156}, \cite{6850649} injects faults into simulated hardware. Some tools inject faults into low-level hardware models like VERIFY\cite{614074} and MAFALDA\cite{Arlat:2002:DCM:506792.506796}. In a short time around the injection, Relyzer\cite{Hari:2012:REA:2248487.2150990} employs the meomery timing simulator and an extra microachiteural and it injects into a commerical functional full-system simulator on ISA level. There are also purely behavior-level machine simulator which injects faults directly into QEMU\cite{Bellard:2005:QFP:1247360.1247401} like F-SEFI\cite{6877352} and Qinject\cite{david2008qinject}.

\cite{4798244} uses a Machine Learning algorithm - Boosted Regression Trees to identify the correlation across workloads, execution phases and processor configurations. \cite{7757917} uses the SVM to recognize faults of the high voltage circuit breaker.
